    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      This platform was designed to support wildlife researchers working with
      large volumes of trail camera imagery. It provides a shared workflow
      for uploading images, extracting metadata, reviewing results, and
      publishing only high-quality data to the public.
    </p>

    <p>
      By combining automated OCR analysis with human validation, the system
      ensures accuracy while enabling collaboration across research teams.

    <h2>Research Workflow</h2>

    <div class="workflow-grid">
      <div class="workflow-step">
        <h3>1. Upload</h3>
        <p>
          Researchers upload trailcam images into a shared staging area.
          Images are not public at this stage.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="workflow-step">
        <h3>2. Analyze</h3>
        <p>
          Metadata is extracted automatically using OCR, including camera ID,
          timestamp, temperature, and pressure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="workflow-step">
        <h3>3. Review</h3>
        <p>
          Researchers collaboratively verify and edit extracted metadata
          before publication.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="workflow-step">
        <h3>4. Publish</h3>
        <p>
          Validated images are published to the public gallery for viewing
          and downstream analysis.
